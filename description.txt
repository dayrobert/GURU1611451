We would like a function to be written in C# for updating the Tab Visibility setting for a given Object for a given Profile. 
The function should accept 3 parameter values - Profile Name, Object Name and Tab Visibility Setting (which would be either "Tab Hidden", 
"Default Off" or "Default On").  As mentioned, using the 3 parameter values, the function should retrieve the tab setting for the given profile
and object and then use the value in the "Tab Visibility Setting" parameter to perform the update and then exit.  The function should use any 
of the Salesforce APIs (Tooling, Metadata, etc.).

This should be a standalone function which we can then plug into our own applications.  It does not need to do anything other than as stated above.
